- x Add copy to clipboard support
  x Add simple text support (to prevent urls from cutting off when pasting elsewhere)
- Add user config to enable columns to display
- Add ability to CRUD task
- Add ability to customize "list" view
- Shorten command?
- Update Readme with more detail and screenshots

From Jeff:
I donâ€™t need/want the urls
Ideally should be sorted by time
and untimed tasks could go up top with a seperator of some sort?
